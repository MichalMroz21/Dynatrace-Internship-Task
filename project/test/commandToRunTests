sudo docker run --rm -w /usr/src/internship_task -v "$(pwd):/usr/src/internship_task" internship_task:latest

put it in terminal opened in test folder.

Difference in internship.cpp files is I added boost::test_tools::output_test_stream, so function saves output in stream reference for test.cpp. And removed solution function, because it's not needed.

Returning a priority queue and then dealing with it in test.cpp seems dumb.
